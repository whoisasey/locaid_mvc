					<p>We want to ensure donors are aware where their donations are going too and how much impact their donation is. <br/> <br/>Many charities receive thousands and thousands of donations yearly and still 90% of that donation ends up with textile recyclers and 14 million tonnes goes to land fills. We want to help donors find charities where their donation will go further. </p>
