				<h3>Why is this important? </h3>
				<div>
					<p>A curated list of organizations and charities that provide full transparency of where your donations go. <br/> <br/> Donors are able to search for organizations and charities based on their own values and beliefs to have maximum impact towards their community.
					</p>
					<p>We want to ensure donors are aware where their donations are going too and how much impact their donation is. <br/> <br/>Many charities receive thousands and thousands of donations yearly and still 90% of that donation ends up with textile recyclers and 14 million tonnes goes to land fills. We want to help donors find charities where their donation will go further. </p>
